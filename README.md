## Oaziz DAO — House of web3 tools for events


1. **Claiming tickets** - Pre-minted and pre-distributed NFT tickets for the BlockShow festival. Tickets and their data are stored on IPFS storage. 
Transaction data and the smart contract itself is available on Polygon mainnet. React was used for developing the client-side of the project.

2. **NFT Memories**

NFT memory is acting as a digital memory of any event user participated in (this includes either an offline or online participation, or just watching a youtube video, livestream, etc.) At Oaziz, NFT Memory is not just a proof of attendance, it is also an embodiment of a remarkable moment people receive and own after the event is over. Our goal is to create smooth and easy-to-use tools with upscale UXUI, so that event organizers can create NFT memories and distribute them easily, without even knowing what Blockchain is and how to use it.
In order to start using our product, you need to install a Metamask wallet, walletConnect (for wallets that can be scanned to connect), or Coinbase wallet.
All transactions for all users will be zero-fee, in other words, FREE.


*a) Creation of identity/citizenship*

Citizenship represents a non-transferable token built on a Polygon mainnet smart contract. Each individual or organization has its own citizenship that contains multiple pieces of data, such as public address, username & userpic, social media links, etc. As a citizen, you always have the ability to update your profile data. This doesn't mean you can change your public address, though - after all, it is a store of your citizenship itself. All the info you decide to add is available inside the created identity aka transaction.


*b) Event creation*

Upon creating the citizenship on our platform, you will also be able to start creating events. As it mentioned above, NFT memory is not just a proof of attendance - it is also a manifestation of a remarkable moment people receive and own after the event is over. Event creation starts with logging all the necessary data in to describe your event with visual components. Logged data is going to be stored on IPFS. After adding all the necessary information, the citizen will have to go through the verification process before creating their first event. The verification helps us to eliminate larger groups of scammers and malicious users that are going to show up eventually. We will store users’ data on IPFS just for once, at the very first time the user creates an event. Further on, the data is going to be stored automatically each time a user creates an event.

*c) NFT Memory minting*

Once your event is verified, you will be available to mint NFTs dedicated to the event you created. You will have to add some descriptions for your NFT or a collection, upload one or several NFTs, and make sure to check everything thoroughly - once you click on the ‘Mint NFT(s)’ button, you can't undo the process. As mentioned above, it's free of charge. Data is going to be stored on IPFS, as well as on Polygon mainnet in a transaction form.


*d) NFT Memory distribution*

Once you successfully minted your NFT(s), you will be able to distribute those to everyone you want. You may set a limited distribution time and choose how many NFT(s) you are planning to distribute via whitelist (to a number of pre-selected users) versus how many will be distributed by the ‘first come, first served’ method. For whitelisted users, you need to add their public addresses the same number of times as the number of NFTs you are willing to distribute. For distribution using via public link, you just need to add the number of NFTs you are willing to distribute and generate a link you can share with your audience. If you’ve done something wrong along the process, you will be able to change the distribution time limit, or the whitelist/public ratio.
