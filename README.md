## Oaziz DAO â€” Web 3 tools making community-owned events a reality


1. **Claiming tickets** - Pre-minted and pre-distributed NFT tickets for the BlockShow festival. Tickets and their data are stored on IPFS storage. 
Transaction data and the smart contract itself is available on Polygon mainnet. React was used for developing the client-side of the project.

2. **NFT Memories**

NFT memory is acting as a digital memory of any event a user participated in (attended an online/offline event, watched a youtube video or a stream etc.)
At Oaziz, NFT Memory is not just a proof of attendance, it is also a remarkable moment people receive and own after events end. Our goal is to create a smooth 
and easy-to-use tools with smooth UXUI so that event organizers can create NFT memories and distribute them easily, without knowing what blockchain is and how to 
use it.

In order to start using our product, you will need to have a Metamask wallet, walletConnect (for wallets that support scanning in order to connect), or Coinbase wallet.

All transactions for all users will be feeless in other words FREE.

*a) Creation of identity/citizenship*

Citizenship represents a non-transferable token made using a smart contract on Polygon mainnet network. Each individual or organization has its own citizenship consisting of multiple data such as a public address, username, social media account links, avatar, etc. You as a citizen always have the ability to update your profile data. Update of your profile data doesn't mean that you can change your public address as it is a store of your complete citizenship itself. Data that you are planning to input are available inside created identity aka transaction.

*b) Event creation*

You will be available to start creating an event if you have created your citizenship on our platform. As it's written above NFT memory is not just proof of attendance, it is also a 
remarkable moment people receive and own after events end. Event creation consists of inputting all necessary data to describe your event with visual components. Input data are going to be stored on IPFS. After input of all necessary data citizen will need to go through a verification process in order to create an event for the first time. The verification process is necessary in order to eleminate larger groups of scammers and malicious users that are going to show up at some moment. Storing data on IPFS by us is going to be done only for the first time when you create an event, every second time data are going to be stored automatically by you create an event.

*c) NFT Memory minting*

If your event gets verified you will be available to mint your NFTs addressed to an event you created. You will be asked to input descriptive data about your NFT or NFT collection, 
upload NFT(s) and make sure once you click on the mint NFT(s) button that you can't undo that process. As mentioned above, it's free of charge. Data are going to be stored on Polygon mainnet in form of transactions as well on IPFS.

*d) NFT Memory distribution*

Once, you successfully minted your NFT(s) you will have the ability to distribute your NFT(s) to everyone you want. You can time limit distribution time and choose how many NFT(s) you are planning to whitelist to known receptions and how many you are going to distribute by a link that will be received by the method first come first served. For whitelisted users, you need to input their receiving public addresses the same number of times as the number of NFT(s) you are willing to distribute them. For distribution using a link, you just need to input the number of NFT(s) you are willing to distribute and generate a link you can share anywhere your audience is placed. If you made some mistake during the process you will be able to change the distribution time limit or change the ratio between whitelisted users and those who will receive it using links.
